NAME
       lexiserver - A Simple Webserver written in C for Educational Purposes

SYNOPSIS
       lexiserver

DESCRIPTION
       lexiserver is a simple web server program written in C for educational purposes.

INSTALLATION
       Run install.sh (e.g., sudo bash install.sh) to create /opt/lexiserver/ and move all the files there.

       For Raspberry Pi users, run lexiserver-arm64 instead.

UNINSTALLATION
       Remove the /opt/lexiserver directory (e.g., sudo rm -rf /opt/lexiserver/).

STARTING AND SERVING DOCUMENTS
       Before starting the server, edit the config file lexiserver.conf to change the WEB_ROOT directory.

       By default, the server looks for HTML documents inside /tmp/www/. You may need to create this directory.

       To start the server, run lexiserver.

       If the client doesn't request any page (e.g., hitting localhost:port), it will serve index.html in /tmp/www or the specified directory.

       To stop the server, kill the PID (Process ID) by running ps aux | grep lexiserver and then kill <pid number>.

WARNING
       This web server is intended for educational purposes. Do not expose it to the internet unless you know what you're doing.

TO DO
       - Implement more error pages (currently only handles 404).
       - Add start, stop, restart arguments.

COMPILING YOUR OWN VERSION
       Compile lexiserver.c with gcc: gcc lexiserver.c -o lexiserver, and move the compiled version to /opt/lexiserver.

       The binary should be alongside lexiserver.conf to work properly. If the config is not present, it will assume defaults.
